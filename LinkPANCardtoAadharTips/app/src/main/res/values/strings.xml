    <string name="ap_3">WHY LINK IS REQUIRED?</string>
    <string name="why_des">
       ➟ Why Link Aadhar With Pan ?\n\n
        ● Both the PAN card as well as the Aadhaar card are unique identification cards that serve as proof of identity that are necessary
        for registration and verification purposes.
        \n\n● The government has urged all entities to link their PAN cards with their Aadhaar cards.
        \n\n ➟ This is being done for the following purposes:\n\nPrevent Tax Evasion :
        \n\n● By linking the Aadhaar and PAN cards, the government will be able to keep tabs on the taxable transactions of a
        particular individual or entity, whose identity and address will be verified by his Aadhaar card.
        \n\n● This will effectively mean that every taxable transaction or activity will be recorded by the government.
        \n\n● As a result, the government will already have a detailed record of all the financial transactions that
        would attract tax for each entity, making tax evasion a thing of the past.
        \n\n ➟ Multiple PAN Cards :
        \n\n● Another
        reason for linking PAN with Aadhaar is to reduce the occurrence of individuals or entities applying for
        multiple PAN cards in an effort to defraud the government and avoid paying taxes.
        \n\n● By applying for more than one PAN card, an entity can use one of the cards for a certain set of
        financial transactions and pay taxes applicable for those.
        \n\n● Meanwhile, the other PAN card can be used for accounts or transactions that the entity
        wishes to conceal from the Income Tax department, thereby avoiding paying tax on them.
        \n\n● By linking the PAN and Aadhaar card, the government will be able to link the identity of an
        entity through his/her Aadhaar card, and subsequently have details of all financial transactions
        made through the linked PAN card.
        \n\n● If there are multiple PAN cards registered under the same name, the government will be able
        to identify the same and take corrective action.</string>

    <string name="ap_4">WHAT IS AADHAR &amp; PAN?</string>
    <string name="what_panadhar_4">● The income tax department of India issues a laminated card which states the
      unique Permanent Account Number (PAN) and other identity details of any person who has applied to obtain a
      PAN Card.
      \n\n● The Permanent Account Number (PAN) was introduced by the Indian Income Tax Department in order to
      facilitate easy retrieval of information and matching information relating to an assess investment, payment
      of taxes, tax demand, tax arrears, raising of loans, assessment, etc. as a universal identification.</string>
